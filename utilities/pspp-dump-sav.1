.SH NAME
pspp\-dump\-sav \- dissect SPSS system file
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpspp\-dump\-sav\fR [\fB\-d \fR| \fB\-\-data\fR[\fB=\fImaxcases\fR]] \fIfile\fR...

.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBpspp\-dump\-sav\fR program reads each SPSS system file
\fIfile\fR and prints its contents.  It is not installed by
default, so it may be missing from your PSPP installation.
The output format is useful for
debugging system file readers and writers and for discovering how to
interpret unknown or poorly understood records.  End users may find
the output useful for providing the PSPP developers information about
system files that PSPP does not accurately read.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR[\fImaxcases\fR]"
.IQ "\fB\-\-data\fR[\fB=\fImaxcases\fR]"
By default, \fBpspp\-dump\-sav\fR does not print any of the data in a
system file, only the file headers.  Specify this option to print the
data as well.  If \fImaxcases\fR is specified, then it limits the
number of cases printed.
.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-help\fR"
Prints a usage message on stdout and exits.
.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR"
.IQ "\fB\-\-version\fR"
Prints version information on stdout and exits.
.
.SH "BUGS"
Some errors that prevent files from being interpreted successfully
cause \fBpspp\-dump\-sav\fR to exit without reading any additional
files given on the command line.
