.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpspp\-output\fR is a command-line utility accompanying PSPP.
It supports multiple operations on SPSS viewer or \fB.spv\fR files,
here called SPV files.  SPSS 16 and later writes SPV files to
represent the contents of its output editor.
.PP
SPSS 15 and earlier versions instead use \fB.spo\fR files.
\fBpspp\-output\fR does not support this format.
.PP
\fBpspp\-output\fR has a number of subcommands, documented separately
below.  \fBpspp\-output\fR also has several undocumented command forms
that developers may find useful for debugging.
.
.SS The \fBdetect\fR command
When invoked as \fBpspp\-output detect \fIfile\fR, \fBpspp\-output\fR
reads enough of \fIfile\fR to determine whether it is an SPV file.  If
so, it exits successfully without outputting anything.  When
\fIfile\fR is not an SPV file or if some other error occurs,
\fBpspp\-output\fR prints an error message and exits with a failure
indication.
.
.SS The \fBdir\fR command
When invoked as \fBpspp\-output dir \fIfile\fR, \fBpspp\-output\fR
prints on stdout a table of contents for SPV file \fIfile\fR.  By
default, this table lists every object in the file, except for hidden
objects.  See the \fBInput Selection Options\fR section below for
information on the options available to select a subset of objects.
.PP
The following additional option for \fBdir\fR is intended mainly for
use by PSPP developers:
.
.IP "\fB\-\-member\-names\fR"
Also show the names of the Zip members associated with each object.
.
.SS The \fBconvert\fR command
When invoked as \fBpspp\-output convert \fIsource destination\fR,
\fBpspp\-output\fR reads the SPV file \fIsource\fR and converts it
to another format, writing the output to \fIdestination\fR.
.PP
By default, \fBpspp\-output\fR infers the intended format for
\fIdestination\fR from its extension.  The known extensions are
generally: \fBcsv html list odt pdf ps spv svg txt\fR.  Use
\fB\-\-help\fR to see an accurate list, since a given installation
might be built without support for some formats.
.PP
See the \fBInput Selection Options\fR section below for information on
the options available to select a subset of objects to include in the
output.  The following additional options are accepted:
.IP "\fB-O format=\fIformat\fR"
Overrides the format inferred from the output file's extension.
\fIformat\fR must be one of the extensions listed above.
.IP "\fB-O \fIoption\fB=\fIvalue\fR"
Sets an option for the output file format.  Refer to the PSPP manual
for details of the available output options.
.IP \fB\-F\fR
.IQ \fB\-\-force\fR
By default, if the source is corrupt or otherwise cannot be processed,
the destination is not written.  These option make \fBpspp\-output\fR
write the output as best it can, even with errors.
.IP \fB\-\-table\-look=\fIfile\fR
Reads a table style from \fIfile\fR and applies it to all of the
output tables.  The file should a TableLook \fB.stt\fR or \fB.tlo\fR
file.
.IP \fB\-\-use\-page\-setup\fR
By default, the \fBconvert\fR command uses the default page setup
(for example, page size and margins) for \fIdestination\fR, or the
one specified with \fB\-O\fR options, if any.  Specify this option
to ignore these sources of page setup in favor of the one embedded
in the SPV, if any.
.SS The \fBget\-table\-look\fR command
When invoked as \fBpspp\-output get\-table\-look \fIsource
destination\fR, \fBpspp\-output\fR reads SPV file \fIsource\fR,
applies any selection options (as described under \fBInput Selection
Options\fR below), picks the first table from the selected object,
extracts the TableLook from that table, and writes it to
\fIdestination\fR (typically with an \fB.stt\fR extension) in the
TableLook XML format.
.PP
Use \fB\-\fR for \fIsource\fR to instead write the default look to
\fIdestination\fR.
.PP
The user may use the TableLook file to change the style of tables in
other files, by passing it to the \fB\-\-table\-look\fR option on the
\fBconvert\fR command.
.SS The \fBconvert\-table\-look\fR command
When invoked as \fBpspp\-output convert\-table\-look \fIsource
destination\fR, \fBpspp\-output\fR reads \fB.stt\fR or \fR.tlo\fR file
\fIsource\fR, and writes it back to \fIdestination\fR (typically with
an \fB.stt\fR extension) in the TableLook XML format.  This is useful
for converting a TableLook \fB.tlo\fR file from SPSS 15 or earlier
into the newer \fB.stt\fR format.
.SS "Input Selection Options"
The \fBdir\fR and \fBconvert\fR commands, by default, operate on all
of the objects in the source SPV file, except for objects that are not
visible in the output viewer window.  The user may specify these
options to select a subset of the input objects.  When multiple
options are used, only objects that satisfy all of them are selected:
.IP "\fB\-\-select=\fR[\fB^\fR]\fIclass\fR..."
Include only objects of the given \fIclass\fR; with leading \fB^\fR,
include only objects not in the class.  Use commas to separate
multiple classes.  The supported classes are:
.RS
.IP
\fBcharts headings logs models tables texts trees warnings
outlineheaders pagetitle notes unknown other\fR
.RE
.IP
Use \fB\-\-select=help\fR to print this list of classes.
.IP "\-\-commands=\fR[\fB^\fR]\fIcommand\fR..."
.IQ "\-\-subtypes=\fR[\fB^\fR]\fIsubtype\fR..."
.IQ "\-\-labels=\fR[\fB^\fR]\fIlabel\fR..."
Include only objects with the specified \fIcommand\fR, \fIsubtype\fR,
or \fIlabel\fR.  With a leading \fB^\fR, include only the objects
that do not match.  Multiple values may be specified separated by
commas.  An asterisk at the end of a value acts as a wildcard.
.IP
The \fB\-\-command\fR option matches command identifiers, case
insensitively.  All of the objects produced by a single command use
the same, unique command identifier.  Command identifiers are always
in English regardless of the language used for output.  They often
differ from the command name in PSPP syntax.  Use the
\fBpspp\-output\fR program's \fBdir\fR command to print command
identifiers in particular output.
.IP
The \fB\-\-subtypes\fR option matches particular tables within a
command, case insensitively.  Subtypes are not necessarily unique: two
commands that produce similar output tables may use the same subtype.
Subtypes are always in English and \fBdir\fR will print them.
.IP
The \fB\-\-labels\fR option matches the labels in table output (that
is, the table titles).  Labels are affected by the output language,
variable names and labels, split file settings, and other factors.
.IP "\-\-nth-commands=\fIn\fR..."
Include only objects from the \fIn\fRth command that matches
\fB\-\-commands\fR (or the \fIn\fRth command overall if
\fB\-\-commands\fR is not specified), where \fIn\fR is 1 for the first
command, 2 for the second, and so on.
.IP "\fB\-\-instances=\fIinstance\fR..."
Include the specified \fIinstance\fR of an object that matches the
other criteria within a single command.  The \fIinstance\fR may be a
number (1 for the first instance, 2 for the second, and so on) or
\fBlast\fR for the last instance.
.IP "\fB\-\-show\-hidden"
Include hidden output objects in the output.  By default, they are
excluded.
.IP "\fB\-\-or\fR"
Separates two sets of selection options.  Objects selected by either
set of options are included in the output.
.PP
The following additional input selection options are intended mainly
for use by PSPP developers:
.IP "\fB\-\-errors\fR"
Include only objects that cause an error when read.  With the
\fBconvert\fR command, this is most useful in conjunction with the
\fB\-\-force\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-\-members=\fImember\fR..."
Include only the objects that include a listed Zip file \fImember\fR.
More than one name may be included, comma-separated.  The members in
an SPV file may be listed with the \fBdir\fR command by adding the
\fB\-\-show\-members\fR option or with the \fBzipinfo\fR program
included with many operating systems.  Error messages that
\fBpspp\-output\fR prints when it reads SPV files also often include
member names.
.IP "\fB\-\-member\-names\fR"
Displays the name of the Zip member or members associated with each
object just above the object itself.
