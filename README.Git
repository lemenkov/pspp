Prerequisites for Building PSPP from Git
----------------------------------------

To build this project from the sources direct from the Git archive,
you must install the prerequisites listed in INSTALL, plus the
following:

	* Autoconf 2.64 (or later).

	* Automake 1.14 (or later).

	* Gettext 0.19 (or later).

	* GNU M4 1.4.9 (or later).

	* pkg-config 0.21 (or later).

        * gperf 3.0.1 (or later).

	* Gnulib (see below for details).

	* libtool 1.5.22 (or later).

	* Texinfo 5.2 or later, to build the documentation.

	* rsvg-convert from librsvg2.

After you install PSPP's prerequisites, you must obtain a copy of
Gnulib, then bootstrap the tree, as described in the sections below.
After that, you may follow the procedure described in INSTALL.

Obtaining Gnulib
----------------

This version of PSPP should work with the Gnulib commit shown below.
Gnulib does not maintain a stable API or ABI, so it is possible that
PSPP will not work with older or newer versions of Gnulib.

 commit ff24917703530849f3b109905d437337cdeeab14
 Author: Bruno Haible <bruno@clisp.org>
 Date:   Fri Jun 3 17:46:27 2022 +0200

     setlocale: Update after Turkey changed its name.

     * lib/setlocale.c: Update comments.

To clone Gnulib into a directory named "gnulib" using Git, and then
check out this particular commit, run these commands:
	git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/gnulib.git gnulib
	cd gnulib
	git checkout $COMMIT
where $COMMIT should be replaced by the commit number listed above
(usually it is sufficient to just type the first 6 or so digits).

If you do not have Git installed, then you may alternately download
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=gnulib.git;a=snapshot;h=$COMMIT;sf=tgz
where $COMMIT is, again, at least the first few digits of the commit
number listed above.  This download will yield a tar.gz file that you
may extract with "gunzip" and "tar" to yield identical results.

Bootstrapping
-------------

Once you have Gnulib installed, PSPP must be "bootstrapped" using the
following command:
	make -f Smake
If you checked Gnulib out in a directory named `gnulib' at the same
level as PSPP, then this is sufficient.  Otherwise, provide the
location of GNULIB on the `make' command line:
	make -f Smake GNULIB=/gnulib/base/directory/name

After executing Smake, follow the procedure described in INSTALL to
build and install PSPP.  On some systems this may be as simple as:
	./configure
	make

Once PSPP is built, you may run its self-tests with:
	make check
or for a more thorough test:
	make distcheck

Building from git on Mac OS
---------------------------

You can build on MacOS in the macports environment. After installing all
required packages to resolve library dependencies and autotools e.t.c, you
run make -f Smake as described above.

The macports system provides the libraries and header files in a separate
location from the MacOS system libraries. The typical locations are

Libraries: /opt/local/lib
Headers:   /opt/local/include

pspp under macports will be linked against the macports libraries. The configure
script has to be informed about the library and header locations. Assume the following
directory structure for an out of tree build:

~/mypspp
  |----pspp    (This is the pspp git directory)
  |----install (The install location containing also ui files for psppire)
  |----build   (The build directory)
  |----gnulib  (The gnulib directory as described above)

Then you can build with the following commands:

    cd ~/mypspp/pspp
    make -f Smake
    cd ../build
    ../pspp/configure --prefix=/Users/USER/mypspp/install \
                  LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib \
		  CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include
    make
    make install
    ../install/bin/psppire (If everything worked, you should see psppire...)
