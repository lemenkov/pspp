@command{pspp-dump-sav} is a command-line utility accompanying
@pspp{}.  It is not installed by default, so it may be missing
from your PSPP installation.
It reads one or more SPSS system files and prints their
contents.  The output format is useful for debugging system file
readers and writers and for discovering how to interpret unknown or
poorly understood records.  End users may find the output useful for
providing the PSPP developers information about system files that PSPP
does not accurately read.

Synopsis:

@display
@t{pspp-dump-sav} [@t{-d}[@var{maxcases}] | @t{-@w{-}data}[@t{=}@var{maxcases}]] @var{file}@dots{}

@t{pspp-dump-sav -@w{-}help} | @t{-h}

@t{pspp-dump-sav -@w{-}version} | @t{-v}
@end display

The following options are accepted:

@table @asis
@item @t{-d}[@var{maxcases}]
@item @t{-@w{-}data}[@t{=}@var{maxcases}]
By default, @command{pspp-dump-sav} does not print any of the data in a
system file, only the file headers.  Specify this option to print the
data as well.  If @var{maxcases} is specified, then it limits the
number of cases printed.

@item @t{-h}
@itemx @t{-@w{-}help}
Prints a usage message on stdout and exits.

@item @t{-v}
@itemx @t{-@w{-}version}
Prints version information on stdout and exits.
@end table

Some errors that prevent files from being interpreted successfully
cause @command{pspp-dump-sav} to exit without reading any additional
files given on the command line.
