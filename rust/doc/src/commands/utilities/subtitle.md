# SUBTITLE

```
SUBTITLE 'SUBTITLE_STRING'.
  or
SUBTITLE SUBTITLE_STRING.
```

`SUBTITLE` provides a subtitle to a particular PSPP run.  This
subtitle appears at the top of each output page below the title, if
headers are enabled on the output device.

Specify a subtitle as a string in quotes.  The alternate syntax that
did not require quotes is now obsolete.  If it is used then the subtitle
is converted to all uppercase.
