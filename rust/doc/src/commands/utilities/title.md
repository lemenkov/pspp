# TITLE

```
TITLE 'TITLE_STRING'.
  or
TITLE TITLE_STRING.
```

`TITLE` provides a title to a particular PSPP run.  This title
appears at the top of each output page, if headers are enabled on the
output device.

Specify a title as a string in quotes.  The alternate syntax that did
not require quotes is now obsolete.  If it is used then the title is
converted to all uppercase.
