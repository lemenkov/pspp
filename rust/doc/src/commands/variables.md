# Manipulating Variables

Every value in a dataset is associated with a
[variable](../language/datasets/variables.md).  Variables describe
[variable](../language/datasets/variables.md).  Variables describe
what the values represent and properties of those values, such as the
format in which they should be displayed, whether they are numeric or
alphabetic and how missing values should be represented.  There are
several utility commands for examining and adjusting variables.
