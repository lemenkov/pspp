# Introduction

GNU PSPP is a tool for statistical analysis of sampled data.  It reads
the data, analyzes the data according to commands provided, and writes
the results to a listing file, to the standard output or to a window
of the graphical display.

The language accepted by PSPP is similar to those accepted by SPSS
statistical products.  The details of PSPP's language are given later
in this manual.

PSPP produces tables and charts as output, which it can produce in
several formats; currently, ASCII, PostScript, PDF, HTML, DocBook and
TeX are supported.

PSPP is a work in progress.  The authors hope to fully support all
features in the products that PSPP replaces, eventually.  The authors
welcome questions, comments, donations, and code submissions.
