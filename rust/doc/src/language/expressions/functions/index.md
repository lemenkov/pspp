# Functions

PSPP functions provide mathematical abilities above and beyond those
possible using simple operators.  Functions have a common syntax: each
is composed of a function name followed by a left parenthesis, one or
more arguments, and a right parenthesis.

   Function names are not reserved.  Their names are specially treated
only when followed by a left parenthesis, so that `EXP(10)` refers to
the constant value e raised to the 10th power, but `EXP` by itself
refers to the value of a variable called `EXP`.
