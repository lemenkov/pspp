/* Creates and returns a new casewriter whose cases are passed
   through TRANSLATE, based on INPUT and auxiliary data AUX.
   (TRANSLATE may also return a null pointer, in which case no
   case is written to the output.)  The translated cases are then
   written to SUBWRITER.

   The cases returned by TRANSLATE must match OUTPUT_PROTO.

   TRANSLATE takes ownership of each case passed to it.  Thus, it
   should either unref each case and return a new case, or
   (unshare and then) modify and return the same case.

   When the translating casewriter is destroyed, DESTROY will be
   called to allow any state maintained by TRANSLATE to be freed.

   After this function is called, SUBWRITER must not ever again
   be referenced directly.  It will be destroyed automatically
   when the translating casewriter is destroyed. */
