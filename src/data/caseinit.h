/* Case initializer.

   The procedure code has to resize cases provided by the active
   dataset data source, to provide room for any other variables that
   should go in the case, fill in the values of "left" variables,
   and initialize the values of other non-left variable to zero
   or spaces.  Then, when we're done with that case, we have to
   save the values of "left" variables to copy into the next case
   read from the active dataset.

   The caseinit data structure provides a little help for
   tracking what data to initialize or to copy from case to
   case. */
