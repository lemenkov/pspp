 This is an abstract base class upon which all (well almost all) windows in
 psppire are based.   The exceptions are transient windows such as the
 splash screen and popups.

 It currently provides the feature where the window's geometry "persists"
 so that she gets the windows appearing in her favourite size/shape/position.
