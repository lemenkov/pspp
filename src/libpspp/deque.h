/* Deque data structure.

   This code slightly simplifies the implementation of a deque as a circular
   queue.  To use it, declare a "struct deque" and a pointer to the element
   type.  For example, for deque of "int"s with an initial capacity of 0:

        struct deque deque = DEQUE_EMPTY_INITIALIZER;
        int *data = NULL;

   Alternatively, to initialize the deque with an initial minimum
   capacity of, e.g., 4:

        struct deque deque;
        int *data = deque_init (&deque, 4, sizeof *data);

   Functions that access elements in the deque return array
   indexes.  This is fairly convenient:

        // Push X at the back of the deque.
        data[deque_push_back (&deque)] = x;

        // Pop off the front of the deque into X.
        x = data[deque_pop_front (&deque)];

        // Obtain the element just past the back of the deque as X.
        x = data[deque_back (&deque, 1)];

   The push functions will not expand the deque on their own.
   Use the deque_expand function if necessary, as in:

        // Push X at the back of the deque, first expanding the
        // deque if necessary.
        if (deque_is_full (&deque))
          data = deque_expand (&deque, data, sizeof *data);
        data[deque_push_back (&deque)] = x;

   Expanding a deque will copy its elements from one memory
   region to another using memcpy.  Thus, your deque elements
   must tolerate copying if their deque is to be expanded. */
