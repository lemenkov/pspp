/* Balanced tree (BT) data structure.

   The client should not need to be aware of the form of
   balancing applied to the balanced tree, as its operation is
   fully encapsulated.  The current implementation is a scapegoat
   tree.  Scapegoat trees have the advantage over many other
   forms of balanced trees that they do not store any additional
   information in each node; thus, they are slightly more
   space-efficient than, say, red-black or AVL trees.  Compared
   to splay trees, scapegoat trees provide guaranteed logarithmic
   worst-case search time and do not restructure the tree during
   a search.

   For information on scapegoat trees, see Galperin and Rivest,
   "Scapegoat Trees", Proc. 4th ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete
   Algorithms, or <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scapegoat_tree>,
   which includes source code and links to other resources, such
   as the Galperin and Rivest paper.

   One potentially tricky part of scapegoat tree design is the
   choice of alpha, which is a real constant that must be greater
   than 0.5 and less than 1.  We must be able to efficiently
   calculate h_alpha = floor(log(n)/log(1/alpha)) for integer n >
   0.  One way to do so would be to maintain a table relating
   h_alpha to the minimum value of n that yields that h_alpha.
   Then, we can track the value of h_alpha(n) in the number of
   nodes in the tree n as nodes are inserted and deleted.

   This implementation uses a different approach.  We choose
   alpha = sqrt(2)/2 = 1/sqrt(2) ~= .707.  Then, computing
   h_alpha is a matter of computing a logarithm in base sqrt(2).
   This is easy: we simply compute twice the base-2 logarithm,
   then adjust upward by 1 if necessary.  See calculate_h_alpha
   for details. */
